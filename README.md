# Project Title

Online Store

## Description of the Project

This Java console application is an online store simulation that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart,
and proceed to checkout.
The intended users are customers looking for a straightforward shopping experience.
The main functionality includes displaying products, managing a shopping cart, and facilitating the checkout process,
aiming to simplify online shopping and enhance user satisfaction.

## User Stories

  application.
